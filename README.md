# Math-Expression-Evaluator-
This program uses stacks to evaluate an arithmetic expression in infix notation without converting it into postfix notation. 
The program takes as input a numeric expression in infix notation, such as 3+4*2, and outputs the result.  
- Operators are +, -, *, / 
- Assume that the expression is formed correctly so that each operation has two arguments. 
- The expression can have parenthesis, for example: 3*(4-2)+6. 
- The expression can have negative numbers. 
- The expression can have spaces in it, for example: 3  *  (4-2)  +6 .
